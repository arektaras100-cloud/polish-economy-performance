            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Poland's economy has demonstrated remarkable resilience during the 2019-2024 period, despite facing significant challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a temporary contraction in 2020, but Poland experienced one of the mildest recessions in the EU, with GDP falling by only 2.5% compared to the EU average of 6.4%.</p>
            <p>The subsequent recovery has been robust, with growth rebounding to 5.9% in 2021 and maintaining positive momentum through 2022-2023, despite energy price shocks and supply chain disruptions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Notably, the influx of Ukrainian refugees since February 2022 has had a positive economic impact, contributing to labor market stability and consumer spending. Over 1 million Ukrainian refugees have integrated into the Polish workforce, helping to address labor shortages in key sectors.</p>

            <h2>The Polish Economy in CEE and EU</h2>
            <p>Poland stands as the largest economy in Central and Eastern Europe and the sixth-largest in the European Union. With a GDP of approximately €720 billion in 2023, Poland accounts for over 40% of the total GDP of the Visegrád Group (Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary).</p>
            <p>Since joining the EU in 2004, Poland has consistently outperformed the EU average in terms of economic growth. Between 2019 and 2024, Poland's cumulative GDP growth was approximately 8.5%, compared to the EU average of 3.2%, despite the pandemic-induced recession.</p>
            <p>EU membership has been instrumental in Poland's economic development, with the country being the largest beneficiary of EU cohesion funds. For the 2021-2027 budget period, Poland has been allocated €76 billion in structural funds and €34 billion from the Recovery and Resilience Facility.</p>

            <p>Poland's economy has demonstrated remarkable resilience during the 2019-2024 period, successfully navigating the COVID-19 pandemic, energy crisis, and geopolitical tensions. Key strengths include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consistent GDP growth outperforming the EU average</li>
                <li>A diversified economic structure with strong manufacturing and growing services sectors</li>
                <li>Expanding export markets and increasing trade volumes</li>
                <li>Low unemployment and a flexible labor market</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, challenges remain, including persistent inflation, demographic pressures, and the need for continued investment in innovation and green technologies.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, Poland's economic outlook remains positive, with forecasts predicting GDP growth of 3.2% in 2025 and 3.5% in 2026. The successful implementation of the National Recovery Plan and continued structural reforms will be crucial for maintaining this growth trajectory and ensuring Poland's convergence with Western European living standards.</p>
